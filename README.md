DESCRIPTION:
Project will create a .asm executable for a given file

IMPLEMENTATION:
I chose to do the local option

NOTE:
From the scanner I used an int value for token ID. This is a reference to each meaning...
1: ID TOKEN
2. NUMBER TOKEN
3. OP TOKEN
4. EOF TOKEN
5. RESERVED WORD TOKEN

***HOW TO RUN***

make: type "make" and press enter
type "make clean" to get rid of object and executable files

run: type "./main <filename>"  (I have a file called test.txt already but you can test with whatever files you want)
example: "./main test.txt"
keyboard input: type "./main" and press enter. Then type your input and press enter.
