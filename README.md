**DESCRIPTION:**
Project will create a .asm executable for a given file

**IMPLEMENTATION:**
I chose to do the local option

**NOTE:**
From the scanner I used an int value for token ID. This is a reference to each meaning...
1: ID TOKEN
2. NUMBER TOKEN
3. OP TOKEN
4. EOF TOKEN
5. RESERVED WORD TOKEN

**HOW TO RUN**

make: type "make" and press enter
type "make clean" to get rid of object and executable files

run: type "./main <filename.ext>"  (I have a file called test.txt already but you can test with whatever files you want)
example: "./main test.txt"
Program will create a file called filename.ext.asm 
**Example:** test.txt.asm
